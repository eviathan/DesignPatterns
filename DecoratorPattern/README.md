# Decorator Pattern

## Description 
In object-oriented programming, the decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.[1] The decorator pattern is often useful for adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern[2] as well as to the Open-Closed Principle, by allowing the functionality of a class to be extended without being modified.[3] Decorator use can be more efficient than subclassing, because an object's behavior can be augmented without defining an entirely new object.

The decorator[4] design pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known design patterns; these describe how to solve recurring design problems and design flexible and reusable object-oriented softwareâ€”that is, objects which are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.

What problems can it solve?
Responsibilities should be added to (and removed from) an object dynamically at run-time.[5]
A flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality should be provided.
When using subclassing, different subclasses extend a class in different ways. But an extension is bound to the class at compile-time and can't be changed at run-time.[citation needed]

What solution does it describe?
Define Decorator objects that

implement the interface of the extended (decorated) object (Component) transparently by forwarding all requests to it
perform additional functionality before/after forwarding a request.
This allows working with different Decorator objects to extend the functionality of an object dynamically at run-time.
